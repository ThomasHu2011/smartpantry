# ML Vision dependencies (CLIP and OCR) - OPTIONAL
# ⚠️ COMMENTED OUT FOR VERCEL: These packages are too large (>3GB) for Vercel's function size limit
# The app will automatically fall back to OpenAI Vision API when ML packages are not available
# 
# To enable ML features (requires alternative hosting like Railway, Render, or AWS Lambda):
# 1. Uncomment the packages below
# 2. Set ML_VISION_ENABLED=true in environment variables
# 3. Deploy to a platform that supports large functions (>3GB)
#
# For Vercel: Keep these commented and use OpenAI API fallback (already implemented)
